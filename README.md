# Virtual-Human

人类正在造人。 弗莱肯斯坦在路上，精神上的人造人。
人类正在重新推进演化，希望创造出自身，以此能更好的理解自身，改造自身。
当人类解码了造人的秘密，演化将大大推进，人类的修复、版本升级，将大大进化。人类2代版本，3代版本，4代，5代，N代，接踵而至，面目全非，可能更高更大更强，也可能更冗余、更笨重、更耗能源。

Machine Learning,  Deep learning, 生成对抗网络，图，类脑计算，脑科学，机器人，柔性技术，虚拟现实，增强现实，人类的边界正在扩展，人类自身也将融合在这进化大潮之中。

生物圈将成为人类的材料厂。 4位的碱基不过是一种语言，甚至不一定是最好的语言。人类肉体编译器在路上。8位的碱基对已出现。     基因工厂已出现，拿功能性片段合成需要的生物结构。

动物是如何有智能的，猩猩是怎么学会100个单词的，小孩子是如何学会语言的，人类的基因是如何让人掌握语言这种技能的。这也是仿生学的角度。
插件技术： AI母体克隆自己的核心分支，然后专门化去定制化功能，定期收回自己的功能性插件，用插件去完成特定的职业教育：  下象棋、打游戏、做手术、开飞机、写作文、画美术、创音乐、拍电影、创造新的数学理论、发现新的材料、同步自己的发现（替代教育、最小社会化功能单位（伴人机器人）、非伴人机器人的崛起）、备份、灾难恢复、复制自己。  

数据化连接是非伴人机器人崛起的科技基础。




A program, knowledge is text based, define Noun, Verb as relations of Noun, Adj , Prep etc,  can hear and speek, can see ( via Camera) and display(via Video window to display pics, representing it's understanding of the world).  

the text DB is including Noun and relations of Noun,  Adj, prep, position( front back left right up down ), time ( past now future)

a noun is normally associated with a picture,   a verb or an event is assosiated with a picture or small video.

computer vision is a realtime camera alaysis tool,  labeling the items, asking for things he does not know, then define it in his DB. and label it.      computer display is a window to show pics representing the noun or verb or event, can searching in the internet then store a tipical pic or small video.         he can display a boy.   a girl,  a thing you name it.  an action,  an event.  a picture which you discribe like:   there is a pig live in a house, he is dring a bottle of water,  it's night and it's cool, he misses his mom.....

He can ask "what's this?" when the camera see something unknown in his text DB.
he saw a 'face' then ask 'who are you or what's your name?" then he remember you and label your face with your name and call you your name afterwards.   he saw your family member and then 'remember' them as well.

he knows the things in your house by asking 'what's this' and defining them in his text DB.

he uses normally only the 'nonus, verb, adj, prep , adv ' from his 'lauguage pack-- his text DB'.

he understands.

the game is called ' what are the things in the world? and what're the relationship of the things?"  

he can talk, tell one or two jokes, play music.   he knows what he talks. 

he is really growing up from time to time.  he reads and he learns. he asks and he difines. he wants to know the game.

I found a similiar project: https://github.com/ARIA-VALUSPA/AVP  , will try to exploite it firstly.
